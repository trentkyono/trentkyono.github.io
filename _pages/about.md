I am an avid enthusiast of artificial intelligence and lately machine learning.  I had the privilege of studying at UCLA under Dr. Judea Pearl (2011 ACM Turing Award) and Mihaela van der Schaar, where my research lies at the intersection of causal models and machine learning. Prior to that, I received my BS in Mathematics/Computer Science at Pepperdine University.  

I currently work for The Boeing Company and lead a small research and engineering team of machine learning practitioners, where we focus primarily on machine learning for Space Domain Awareness (SDA).  I also lead internal machine learning R&D efforts for autonomous aerial applications.  

Depending on who you ask, I have too many hobbies.  But on my spare time, you can find me either playing basketball, golf, fishing, and spending time with my family.
