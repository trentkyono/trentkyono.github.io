I am an avid enthusiast of artificial intelligence, machine learning research, and software engineering.  I had the privilege of studying at UCLA under Dr. Judea Pearl (2011 ACM Turing Award) and Mihaela van der Schaar, where my research lies at the intersection of causal models and machine learning. Prior to that, I received my BS in Mathematics/Computer Science at Pepperdine University.  

I currently work for The Boeing Company and lead a small research and engineering team of machine learning practitioners, where we focus primarily on machine learning for Space Domain Awareness (SDA).  Additionally, I lead internal machine learning R&D efforts for autonomous aerial refueling capabilities.  Lastly, I work as a researcher on a DARPA program that investigates machine learning robustness for autonomy in commercial and military aircraft.

Depending on who you ask, I have too many hobbies.  Regardless, on my spare time, you can find me either playing basketball, golf, fishing, and spending time with my family.  I also enjoy video games, mobile gaming, and fish keeping.  I try my best to balance my desk life with a healthy diet and a lot of physical exercise.
